## My process

### Technology Used

- [**Advice Slip API:**](https://api.adviceslip.com/) The API used to fetch random advice dynamically.
- [**Tailwind CSS:**](https://tailwindcss.com/) A utility-first CSS framework to streamline styling.

### What I learned

1. **Handling API JSON Data:** I explored using the Fetch API to retrieve and process JSON data from an api dynamically.
2. **Fetch API Cache Option:** I utilized the cache option of the Fetch API to override the default API behavior and request a fresh quote on each button click.
3. **Request Debouncing:** I applied a debouncing technique to efficiently manage API requests, preventing multiple requests from firing simultaneously.

### Useful resources
